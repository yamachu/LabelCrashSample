# LabelCrashSample Xamarin.Forms for iOS

This project is sample implementation to reproduce ListView bug.

## Cases

If we use Xamarin.Forms 2.4.0.x, this application will crash when click button.

But we use Xamarin.Forms 2.3.5-pre6, it behaves as we expected.

## Others

I also had a similar [problem](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=59813) in my other project, so I tried to reproduce the problem.
But I found other problem.
